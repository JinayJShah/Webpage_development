            <h3 class="headline">Not just Modi's personality, this key factor was behind BJP's massive win in 2019 elections</h3>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The BJP's victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha election is extraordinary in more ways than one. While crossing the 300-seat mark — the first time for any political party since the 1984 election — is itself a remarkable achievement, it is the size of individual victories at the constituency level that truly reveals the sheer scale of the BJP's success.</p><br>
                <p>The BJP got more than 50 per cent of the vote share in 16 states and Union Territories, and in more than 200 constituencies across the country. This means that in each of these constituencies, the BJP candidate got more votes than all the other candidates put together. </p><br>
                <p>For any incumbent government, there are three key factors that play a role in determining electoral success or failure: performance, organisation and vision.</p><br><br>
                <p>The perceptions around BJP's performance in the last five years were hardly enough to put it on a strong wicket. Most macro-economic indicators point to high unemployment and widespread rural distress. </p><br>
